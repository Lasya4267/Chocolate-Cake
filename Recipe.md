Start by mixing the dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls.
Add the wet/buttermilk mixture to the dry flour mixture and mix the batter until well combined.
Pour boiling water into the batter and stir until smooth. The batter will be very thin!
Pour the batter into your cake pans and bake the cakes on the middle rack of the oven.
